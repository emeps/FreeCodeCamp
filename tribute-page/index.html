      <h3 id="headline"> Life story of Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong> 1768 </strong> - Born in Auxerre, France. </li>
        <li> <strong> 1777 </strong> - Your Mother dies. </li>
        <li> <strong> 1778 </strong> - Your Father dies. </li>
        <li> <strong> 1781 </strong> - He entered the military school of Auxerre and began to interest in mathematics.
        </li>
        <li> <strong> 1782 </strong> - Read the six volumes of the Mathematics Course by Etienne Bezout. </li>
        <li> <strong> 1783 </strong> - Receives his first prize for studying Charles Bossut's General Mechanics. </li>
        <li> <strong> 1787 </strong> - Left the Auxerre Military School and entered the Benedictine Abbey of St.
          Benoit-sur-Loire. </li>
        <li> <strong> 1789 </strong> - Even with an interest in mathematics, he left the abbey without making any
          religious
          vows.
        </li>
        <li> <strong> 1789 </strong> - He visited Paris where he presented an article to the Royal Academy of French
          Science on
          your searches for the
          solution of numerical equations. </li>
        <li> <strong> 1790 </strong> - He became professor of mathematics at the military school in Auxerre. </li>
        <li> <strong> 1793 </strong> - He joined the Auxerre Revolutionary Committee. Wrote:
          <blockquote cite="https://books.google.com.br/books?id=z3XxDwAAQBAJ&"> "While natural ideas of equality were
            developed, it was possible to conceive hope
            sublime of
            establish a free government among us, exempt from kings and priests and free the usurped soil from this
            double yoke
            gives
            Europe. I fell in love with this cause, which in my opinion is the biggest and most beautiful that a nation
            can
            to undertake. "<cite> - Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier. </cite>
          </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li> <strong> 1794 </strong> - Due to the terror generated by the French Revolution and its political
          involvement,
          Fourier ended up in prison. </li>
        <li> <strong> 1794 </strong> - He ended up being released due to new political changes. </li>
        <li> <strong> 1794 </strong> - Appointed to study at the École Normale in Paris, with the aim of teaching
          teachers. With professors Joseph-Louis de Lagrange, Pierre Simon Laplace and Gaspard Monge. </li>
        <li> <strong> 1795 </strong> - He was arrested and released after appeals from his students and teachers, but
          returned
          to teaching
          at the École Polytechnique where I was teaching. </li>
        <li> <strong> 1797 </strong> - He succeeded Lagrange when he was appointed to the chair of Analysis and
          Mechanics at the
          École
          Polytechnique. </li>
        <li> <strong> 1798 </strong> - He joined Napoleon on his Expedition to Egypt and was elected governor and
          secretary
          of the Institute of Egypt.
        </li>
        <li> <strong> 1801 </strong> - He returned to France and was named Mayor of Isère, a post he kept until
          Restoration. Having later appointed Mayor of Grenoble, where he developed most of his work on
          spread of heat. </li>
        <li> <strong> 1820 </strong> - Fourier calculated that an object the size of the Earth and, at its distance from
          the
          Sun,
          it should be considerably colder than if the planet was heated only by the effects of solar radiation
          incident. Discovering the "greenhouse effect". </li>
        <li> <strong> 1822 </strong> - Wrote Theorie Analytique de la Chaleur (Analytical Theory of Heat). Contributing
          for the fundamentals of thermodynamics. Opens the mathematical area of ​​Fourier analysis theory. However, a
          excessive and little simplification
          rigorous, generate much criticism from Laplace and Lagrange. In particular, in this work Fourier states that a
          function of a variable, continuous or discontinuous, can be expanded in a series of sines of multiples of the
          variable. </li>
        <li> <strong> 1829 </strong> - Presented the final version of the work called Fourier's theorem, with the help
          of
          Johann Dirichlet, François Budan de Boislaurent and Jacques Charles François Sturm. </li>
        <li> <strong> 1830 </strong> - Fourier dies in Paris, France. </li>
